## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The architecture and the decisions behind it are written down (#2):
  a Go control plane and a Python LangGraph runner, Rotor as an OAuth
  client of each tool with refresh tokens kept in OpenBao, one sandbox per
  run that is destroyed when idle, and workflows as versioned YAML. See
  `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/decisions.md`.
- A development stack and a test gate (#1). `make up` starts Postgres,
  Valkey, Keycloak with the suite's realm `dynamo` and an OpenBao dev server
  configured for Rotor, on ports of the checkout's own; `./run-tests.sh` runs
  the same layers locally and in CI, and the realm gains Rotor's sign-in
  client, its control-plane service account and the `rotor-administrators`
  group.
